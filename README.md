Event Ticket Reservation System
Welcome to the Event Ticket Reservation System! This project implements an efficient ticket booking system for events, designed in C++ using fundamental Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) concepts.

Features
Priority Queue for Seat Reservations
Seats are managed using a priority queue to ensure that reservations are handled efficiently based on predefined priorities (e.g., VIP seats, regular seats).

Hash Maps for User Profiles
User profiles are stored and retrieved using hash maps, allowing fast access and updating of user data.

Booking System
Users can book, cancel, and view reservations seamlessly.

Event Management
Admins can add, update, or remove events and manage ticket availability.

Key Concepts Used
Priority Queues: Efficient seat management based on priority.
Hash Maps: Fast and reliable user data storage.
Dynamic Memory Management: For efficient use of system resources.
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): Modular and maintainable code structure.
